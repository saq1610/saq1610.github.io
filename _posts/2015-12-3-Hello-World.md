Ah. Finally. So you may have noticed that I have been fiddling around with my site for quite a while. After trying thousands, literally thousands of blogging platforms I have finally settled on *Jekyll*.

### What's Jekyll?

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

### Why Jekyll?

I settled upon Jekyll because I grew tired of Wordpress, Blogger, Tinypress, Octopress, Divshot and the like. What I really wanted was a simple, fast and minimalist blogging experience. Something which even allowed me to write in simple Markdown even in a command line shell and be hosted free on Github. Jekyll gave me all this plus more, it had an amazing documentation (the best I have ever seen so far) an equally amazing community and pure awesomeness of writing like a hacker.
